# CaptivePortals
This are login pages written in html. You can use them for a captive portal. I recommend not to use it for criminal activities. 
The pages are login forms from: Facebook, Apple, Bunq Bank, Bol.com, Marktplaats, Coinbase, Gmail, Google, Disney+, RDW, 
Netflix, Twitter (X), Microsoft, Videoland, Yahoo, SAP, Mijn Pathe, Knab, Snapchat, DigiD, Bitvavo. You can 
open the files in a code editor and customize the pages. You can use the files as a fake login page and if someone logs in you can receive the
login credentials like the given password and emailaddress. Or you can set up a wifi network with a captive portal so people have to log in before they can
use the network.
